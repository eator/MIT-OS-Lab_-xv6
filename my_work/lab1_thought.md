# The road of Finishing Lab1

Set lab environment is so easy that I can't praise it more.

The testing and grading tools are complete.

## issuses
xv6 trap machanism: can't be familar with it enoughly

xv6 program stack: a comparative small limited size, which bothered me a lot, and the trap
condition is led by the stackoverflow.

xv6 arguments: be careful that in the function exec(), the first one of arguments 

are generally ignored, which stands for the program name.
